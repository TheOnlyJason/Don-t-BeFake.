# DontBeFake
DontBeFake, is a web-app for schedule planning, with a little added spice. 

# Documentation:

For quick-installation:
Make sure you have the latest version of node installed and are using Visual Studio Code as hosting platform.
To host the website locally, navigate through DontBeFake/FrontEnd and type in the terminal:
```

This will create a node-modules package that houses many dependencies used in the program. 
Next, we must start the "BackEnd" part of our server.
Create a new terminal and navigate to DontBeFake/FrontEnd/src/server and run the following terminal command:
```
node server.js
```
To host the website on a local web-browser, go back to the original terminal and run:
```
npm start
```
You are now all set to run DontBeFake! To start, head over to the login page by clicking on the top-right avatar.
